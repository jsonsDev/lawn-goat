# LawnGoat Landscaping

LawnGoat Landscaping ([view project](JsonsDev.github.io/lawn-goat)) is a ficticious company I created to add a little extra to The Odin Project's (TOP) first [landing page assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). 

This project was part of TOP's section on Flexbox Layout in the Foundations Course. It required an entire web page coded from a design provided (included below).

I followed the overall format with some of my own modifications:

- Custom branding w/ logo design created in Adobe Illustrator
- Created icons for services section (also Adobe Illustrator)
- Modified the color scheme more suited for a landscaping company

Design provided by TOP for this project:
